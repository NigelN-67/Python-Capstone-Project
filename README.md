# CoreLedger Retail Engine (Retail / Financial Service System — Python Capstone Project)

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack Python retail and financial service system designed to simulate real-world business operations such as transaction processing, customer management, inventory tracking, and financial record handling.

The system integrates multiple core computer science and software engineering concepts including data processing, automation, API interaction, object-oriented design, and database management; demonstrating how Python can be used to build scalable solutions for retail and financial environments.

The goal of this project is to design a practical, efficient, and secure service platform that models how modern retail and financial systems operate.

## Motivation

Retail and financial service providers rely heavily on automated systems to manage large volumes of transactions, customer data, and financial records. This project explores how software systems handle:

* Transaction processing and record keeping
* Data storage and retrieval
* Customer account management
* Inventory tracking
* External service integration
* Data validation and error handling

The project was developed as a capstone to apply Python programming concepts learnt as part of the course to a real-world business use case.

## Research and Technical Foundation

The system design is based on extensive study of modern software development practices and Python programming concepts, including:

* **Variables, expressions, and control structures** for business logic implementation
* **Conditional statements and loops** for transaction workflows and validation
* **File handling** for persistent data storage
* **Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets)** for efficient data management
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for modular and scalable architecture
* **Advanced OOP principles** such as encapsulation and abstraction
* **Database integration** for structured financial records
* **APIs and web services** for external data interaction
* **Regular expressions** for data validation and processing
* **Web scraping techniques** for automated data collection

The project architecture follows modular design principles to improve maintainability, scalability, and performance.

## Features

* Customer account creation and management
* Retail transaction processing
* Financial record tracking
* Data validation and error handling
* Persistent data storage using files or databases
* External API integration
* Modular object-oriented design
* Automated data processing

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture consisting of:

* **User Module** — manages customer accounts and authentication
* **Transaction Module** — handles purchases and financial operations
* **Data Management Module** — handles storage and retrieval
* **Service Integration Module** — interacts with external APIs or services

This structure promotes separation of concerns and system scalability.
